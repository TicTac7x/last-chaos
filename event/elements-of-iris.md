# Event - Elements of Iris

![event]

## Official Story
_A merchant named Toldar suddenly appears in the Lost City of Dratan.
As we move closer, we see he would like to talk.
He has a quest but warns it will be long and arduous and not for the faint of heart.
Will you be the hero to accept and be heralded henceforth?_

_First, you must teleport into Dratan City._

_From there you will venture forth to the Lost City in Dratan, to the lower right of the map.
This place used to be the hub of Dratan before the war of the gods when it was destroyed._

_There you will find a lone merchant named Toldar who needs your assistance._

_Toldar requires you to gather the following items for him,
then he will be able to show you some magic which only he is able to do
and has been lost to the generations since the war.
The items will not be available all together, nor are they able to be gathered for long
…so take heed and gather quickly.

___NOTE__: The items will drop on any map and from all monsters on all maps
which are within your characters levelrange
(i.e. Grass of Juno will drop on ALL maps, not just Juno!)_

&nbsp;

![grass-of-juno]
__Grass of Juno__ - This grass has a sweet, homely smell native only to Juno. Smelling it reminds one of happier times and sunnier climates.

![sand-of-dratan]  
__Sands of Dratan__ – This sand is warm and inviting, if you are ever cold and lonely, simply holding this sand will warm you up.

![fire-of-merac]  
__Fire of Merac__ – This fire comes from the land of volcanoes and lava. Use this fire to light your way when you are lost in the dark, or to scare away the wild monsters as you rest.

![stone-of-egeha]  
__Stone of Egeha__ – A very odd mix of stormy, blue skies has created this stone. It is cool to the touch and brings a familiarity of safety to the holder.

![rain-of-streiana]  
__Rain of Streiana__ – The rains of Streiana were glorious and inviting before the war. Then, they created and sustained life instead of corrupting and taking life as they do now.

![snow-of-bloodymir]  
__Snow of Bloodymir__ – Bloodymir’s constant snow squalls and frigid temperatures are famous throughout the lands. This snow sure can cool off even the most overheated traveler.

&nbsp;

_Once you have gathered the items Toldar requires of you,
he will ask you which pendant you would like to see him magically create before your very eyes.
Choose carefully hero, as once his magic has begun it cannot be stopped._

&nbsp;

__Thatched Grass Pendant__ – This accessory is embedded with a stone created from Juno Grass and contains special properties to assist you in your journeys. Seals include Strength, HP Absorption, Evasion and Skill cooldown.


__Glass of Sands Pendant__ – These beads may look like the Sands of Dratan, but through special magic and heating they are glass. The properties they have been infused with are perfect for some travelers. Seals include Dexterity, HP Absorption, Hit Rate, and Movement Speed.


__Fire Stone Pendant__ – The magical properties of fire are captured in this mystical looking pendant. The lava and fire from ancient volcanoes have been imbued within. Seals include Intelligence, MP Absorption, Evasion, and Decreased MP use.


__Stormy Skies Pendant__ – Blue skies and clouds, the perfect storm. This pendant embodies all that is the dark stone from the Egeha sky…. calm and storm combined into artistic irony. Seals include Constitution, MP Absorption, Hit Rate, and Silence Resistance.


__Water Infused Pendant__ – The potion shaped pendant glows with the pure waters of Streiana from the pre-war era. It is rumored to keep the spirits at bay. Seals include HP increase, HP Absorption, Hit Rate, and Stun resistance.


__Cold Snowstone Pendant__ – Who would have thought you could have an accessory comprised of snow? Well, through ancient magic and sub-arctic temperatures it is possible and perfect for the warm-blooded traveler. Seals include MP increase, MP Absorption, Evasion, and Stone Resistance.
