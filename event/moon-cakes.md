## Official Story
During this event, Lorraine put on her apron, rolled up her sleeves, and got down to baking amazing cookies.

Your task is to find the ingredients that she needs: flour, egg yolks and vanilla.

You acquire them while hunting monsters in all the lands of Iris. Watch out for the delicate yolk - Do not shake the backpack!

All components must be returned to Lorraine to back mooncakes.

She is a new baker, so her creations do not always turn on correctly. Mooncakes that do not bake will burn or scatter, unfortunately, will not be fit to eat.

But when they come out ... yum yum!
Mooncakes are not only very tasty. Their particular advantage is that the increase for 5 minutes in both attack speed and movement.

But it is not only the players that have an appetite for these wonderful vanilla biscuits, Landy (Doman Merchant) is also very find of them and will gladly give you something special, or pay gold, if you bring her full basket.

Bring 10 Mooncakes to Lorraine and she will line them in a basket designed for Landy. The mooncakes are very delicate and it may happen that during the baking, they get ruined instead.
